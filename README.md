This project aims to analyze and explore the structure of a social network using graph theory concepts. In the graph model, each person is represented as a node, and an edge is drawn between two nodes if they are friends. The graph is represented using an adjacency matrix, which allows efficient storage and retrieval of connections between individuals.

To perform meaningful analysis, I implemented graph traversal techniques and used Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between any two individuals in the network. This helps in identifying the minimum number of connections or "hops" required to reach from one person to another, revealing insights into the network's connectivity and centrality.

Key features of the project include:

Representation of social relationships using graph data structures

Use of adjacency matrix to store friendship connections

Application of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path finding

Analysis of network proximity and relationship chains between users

This project demonstrates how classic graph algorithms can be applied to understand and analyze real-world social networks.
